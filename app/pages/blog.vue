          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <li><strong>Preserve Memories:</strong> Printed photos can be stored in albums or frames, ensuring that your memories are preserved for years to come. Digital images, on the other hand, can be lost due to hardware failure or accidental deletion.</li>
            <li><strong>Add a Personal Touch:</strong> Printed photos can be customized and displayed in your home, adding a personal touch to your decor. They serve as reminders of special moments and can evoke powerful emotions when revisited.</li>
            <li><strong>Share with Loved Ones:</strong> Physical prints make it easy to share memories with family and friends. Whether you’re sending a postcard or gifting a framed photo, printed images create a tangible connection.</li>
          </ul>
